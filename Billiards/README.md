About project

The project aims to simulate different billiard models and investigate their properties using a simulation approach. The specific models
covered include a circular billiard, a vertical circular billiard, and a horizontal stadium billiard.
Here we are seeing different models of billard models , but the whole aim is to study particles paths, reflections and momentum changes. 
The whole project was very informative, the discussions helps us to understand the aim of this project. The main idea here is how the
mechanics and real life things connected with each other and mechanics is present in our deaily life. We can see that the whole project 
is applied on billiard, which is from our real life. 
From the poject and from the tasks we can make conclusion which is that the balls are moving irregular, each of them are going to 
different sides regardless of different models and this is the whole conclusion of our project.
