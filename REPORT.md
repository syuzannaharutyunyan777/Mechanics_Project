Mechanics_Project

What is the conclusion of the project and what I have learned from it.

Overall, the project was very interesting and I have learned a lot from this project.What I have done, I have created Spring class, then SpringArray class, which was the first two tasks. Then in the third problem, I have written the Fourier Transform code, which I have understood how it works during our class, also I have read about it in the book. Then in task 4, I have created a converter, which is going to convert binary to decimal. Task 5 , 6 , 7 extends the converter method and gives different outputs, because there are 3 main methods which are extended from this class: Converter 8 Bit, ConverterInt and ConverterFloat. But the whole idea I have got during the Office Hour, that our aim is to convert the spring to binary. For example, we can represent that if the input is 0, then the spring has 0 stiffness, or if the input is 1, we have unit spring of stiffness 1. So the whole idea here is to convert spring to binary then from binary convert to other systems. Additionally, after testing the whole project I have got negative and positive numbers, and in OH we have discussed that the answer could have negative numbers too, because the spring can have parallel and not parallel conditions which will have the same output, but will change the sign for not parallel one.
Overall, the project has taught us the application of Fourier, testing of different methods and application of different methods. Implementation was time consuming, but worth it, because the aim of this project was to show how mechanics is connected to computer science. How we have used our intro to cs, data structures and OOP knowledge in mechanics and finally how the springs can be converted to binary systems.
